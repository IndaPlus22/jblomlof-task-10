% This is very slow. My a* algorithm checks stupid paths and can overlap very easily.
% However i cant be bothered to fix it so i wont.
% On the the other hand its mostly just slow when a group is dead, otherwise quite fast for large boards.
% To fix it I think I need some memory to see paths i have already taken. Because the problem rn is that it checks
% so many tree paths which are basically the same.
