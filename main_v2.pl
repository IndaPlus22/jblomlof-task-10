%It was a very slow boi. But I did some changes. My thought process was as follow

% A way to make this faster is to terminate every search that steps on a tile we already searched for
% E.g if we taken path [[2,2], [2,3].....] (path-1)
% and we are now searching the path [[3,3], [2,3]] we can realize that our path that we are on is now doomed to fail
% if path-1 also failed. We can only search paths that path-1 already searched or search squares path-1 already tried to search.
% So lets save every path we done and compare if our newest square is in any of the paths.
% Bonus: I dont even need to keep track where in what direction i cant go anymore.
% I cant make it work (well it works but not optimized). It cant return the paths it took, well, because its just false.


% Now a Very fast boi
% Using memory to remember squares it doesnt like
