I've now added a faster solution and provided all my example boards that I used. And I think it works. I have tested the following commands in the enviroment:  
run_pr(1,1, 'big_board_dead.txt'). % is false, and its fast, faster than flash.
run_pr(9,5, 'big_board_dead.txt').  % is false
run_pr(4,5, 'board_alive.txt'). %is true
run_pr(4,6, 'board_dead.txt'). % is false
run_pr(9,9, 'big_board_alive.txt'). % is true
run_pr(1,1, 'big_board_alive.txt'). % is true

From what I can tell it works perfectly fine, Altough I would need a Kattis problem to make sure...
